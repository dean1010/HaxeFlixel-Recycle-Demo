# HaxeFlixel-Recycle-Demo

 A simple example of object pooling and recycling. The group of bullets will grow by creating new bullets as needed, 
 depending on the maxSize of the group. Otherwise, if dead bullets are available it will recycle them from the pool. 
 This way we reuse a small pool of bullets to fire many.
